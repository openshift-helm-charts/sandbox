# development

This repository is used for developing and testing worklows and scripts for the charts repository.

# Release process

Periodically the workflows and scripts from this repository will be "released" into the charts repository for live use by chart submitters. At the same time any charts added to the chart repository will be added to this repository. This is an automated process which can be started by any approver of the repository.

To start the proecess:
1. Modify the [release/release_info.json](https://github.com/openshift-helm-charts/development/blob/main/release/release_info.json) file with information about the release. Information includes:
   - The version of the new release.
   - Information to describe the content of the release.
   - For each of the chart repository and  development repository.
     - merges: a directory/file which is to be merged with the same directory in the other repository. 
     - replaces : a directory/file which will be deleted from the other repository and replaced with the same directory/file from the specifying repository. This also covers new directories added.
     - ignores : a directory or files which is part of the merge or replace but should be excluded. This also covers deleted files.
   - For example, release/release_info.json for the charts repository specifies a merge of the charts directory. This means the charts of the charts repository will be merged into the same directory in the development repository. This effectively updates the development repository with the charts which were added since that last release.
   - For example, release/release_info.json for the development repository specifies a replace of the scripts directory. This means the scripts directory will be deleted from the charts repository and replaced with the scripts directory and its contents from the development repository.
   - For example, release/release_info.json for the development repository specifies an ignore of the scripts/src/release directory. This means after copying the entire content of the scripts to the charts repository the specific directory will then be removed. 
1. Create a Pull Request against the development repository contaning only the release/release_info.json. The relase workflow then:
    1. Clones the development and charts repositories.
    1. Updates each the repositories based on the content of the release/release_info.json.
    1. Creates a pull request against the chart repository containing workflow updates from the development repository.
        - This PR will need to be manually merged once all tests are finished and clean.
    1. Creates and pushes a commit to the main branch of the development repository. The branch contains chart updates from the chart repository.
        - It is expected that the time between cloning the repository and pushing the commit to main will be short enough to prevent overwriting other merged chnages.
    1. Assuming all is good, auto-merges the release/release_info.json pull request, and then creates a release and tag for the release in the development repository.
