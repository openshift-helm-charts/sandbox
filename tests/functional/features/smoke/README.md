#Smoke Test Suite

These feature files contains all the smoke tests (a subset of the all the feature files present under "features" directory).

Smoke tests will run as part of the any workflow change done in the certifcation flow.

This test suite cover the basic features of chart certification flow. Also tries to touch each verndor_type ie partners, redhat and community.

## Time Limit

Motivation to design this test suite was to minimize testing time and any future test addition to this test suite should not exceed testing time limit of 30 minutes.
